General Social Survey Dataset 

The GSS gathers data on American society in order to monitor and explain trends in attitudes, behaviors, and attributes. The GSS contains a standard core of demographic, behavioral, and attitudinal questions, plus topics of special interest.

This repo contains data from the GSS 2018 survey, along with the GSS codebook which provides more details about the variables collected. If you are interested in examining other years of the GSS, visit http://gss.norc.org/Get-The-Data to download the data.
